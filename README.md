[![Massimiliano Bertinetti's Github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=maxbertinetti&show_icons=true&theme=radical)](https://github.com/maxbertinetti/github-readme-stats)

I started my programmer journey in 1987 with a Commodore Amiga 500.
It was a fun computer to program (and for playing).

Then I continued to program (only for passion) for years, doing other activities for a living (a part from a 1 year parenthesis on 2009)

Finally I started programming professionally from 2016.

I'm very passionate about Open Source programming languages.

- ðŸ“˜ I'm currently learning Haskell
