I started my programmer journey in 1987 with a Commodore Amiga 500.
It was a fun computer to program (and for playing).

Then I continued to program (only for passion) for years, doing other activities for a living (apart from a 1 year parenthesis on 2009)

Finally I started programming professionally from 2016.

I'm very passionate about Open Source programming languages.
